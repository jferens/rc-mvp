or any other applicable law, regulation, rule, guideline or order (collectively, "Export Laws"). You will comply with all 
Export Laws to ensure that the SDK is not exported, directly or indirectly, in contravention of the Export Laws. You

in violation of this Section 12 is void. The laws of State of Washington ("WA") govern all matters arising out of this 
Agreement. The courts of the WA will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising under this agreement. You agree 
that termination and/or monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy if you breach this agreement and that YI will be 
entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court 
of competent jurisdiction in the event of a breach. If YI does not exercise any legal right or remedy in this agreement or 
otherwise, this will not be taken to be a formal waiver by YI of its rights, which rights will remain available to YI. If any
provision of this agreement is construed to be illegal or invalid, the illegal or invalid provisions will be deemed stricken 
and deleted herefrom to the same extent and effect as if never incorporated herein, but all other provisions hereof will 
continue in full force and effect. This agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. If for any reason a court of competent 
jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of this agreement shall continue in 
full force and effect and the unenforceable provision or portion thereof will be replaced by an enforceable provision that 
most closely reflects the economic effect and intent of the unenforceable provision or portion thereof.

13. Complete Agreement; Governing Language. This agreement is the entire agreement between you and YI with respect to the 
subject matter of this agreement, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings regarding such subject matter. 
No amendment to or modification of this License will be binding unless in a writing that both identifies itself as an 
amendment to this agreement and is signed by an officer of YI. Any translation of this agreement is done for reference only 
and will have no legal or other effect. In the event of a dispute between the English and any non-English versions, the 
English version of this agreement shall govern.
